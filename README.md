## [Watch Now: Welcome to the Webex Contact Center API Samples](https://app.vidcast.io/share/861a3320-669c-4edb-b284-3c1300130583)

## Getting Started

To get started, create an App Integration on the Developer Portal:
( This will help you obtain your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` ).

- Sign into developer.webex-cx.com with a valid Webex Control Hub Account.
- Create an Application Integration by going to your Profile > Manage My Apps.
- Creating an Application Integration will give you a set of Client ID and Client Secret that you will need for this sample.
- Note: While entering the Redirect URI, ensure it has the right URL. For example, for postman, it is : `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback`
- For your local app, it will be in the format: `http://localhost:{port}/{path}`

## Disclaimer

> These samples are meant to be used, as "samples", for demos, and to understand how to interact with the WebexCC APIs.
> When building a production grade solution, please consider the overall architecture and design with a security first approach.
> Also, please consider how you would extend this app for multiple orgs, manage tokens for the orgs, etc.
> These samples are only meant to provide working, starter code and many layers have been simplified and abstracted away to focus on the Webex Contact Center use cases.
