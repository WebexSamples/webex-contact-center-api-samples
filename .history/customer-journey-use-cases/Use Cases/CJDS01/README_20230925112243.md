<h2>Motivation <a id="motivation"></a></h2>

> Contact center agents work with many different customers with various problems throughout the day. On the other hand, customers expect businesses to know who they are, why they are calling, and provide them with assistance regarding their issue. Agents must then know everything about a customer in a limited amount of time.

> As a contact center agent, I would like to view key customer insights and their history across all the touchpoints every time I interact with them to better understand their requirements and provide a personalized experience.
