## Disclaimer

> These samples are meant to be used, as "samples", for demos, and to understand how to interact with the WebexCC APIs.
> When building a production grade solution, please consider the overall architecture and design with a security first approach.
> Also, please consider how you would extend this app for multiple orgs, manage tokens for those orgs, etc.
> These samples are only meant to provide working, starter code and many layers have been simplified and abstracted away to focus on the Webex Contact Center use cases.
